# Intel Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This repository contains the code and report for the image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project was part of the Deep Learning Project 2022 and focuses on classifying images from the Intel Image Classification dataset into six different categories.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to build and optimize CNN models to classify images accurately into six distinct classes using the Intel Image Classification dataset. The project was completed as part of an assignment and includes several models, such as a baseline CNN model, an improved model with hyperparameter tuning, and a final model utilizing transfer learning with VGG16.
